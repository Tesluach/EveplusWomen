                    <td>Two items I recommend here are things that I personally carry when walking alone. They are both very safe for the user</br>
                        and legal to carry in my state. Pepper Spray -- Relatively easy to find at places like hardware stores or sporting goods</br>
                        stores. Self Defense Keychains -- You put your forefinger and middle finger through the eyes of the plastic cat and hold</br>
                        your keys in your fist. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to strike out, the firm plastic prongs deliver</br>
                        a major ouch to your assailant. Again, because it is linked to your hand it is much less likely to get wrestled away from</br>
                        you or turned against you. *For items like this, check legality in your state. It's plastic, but some places may still</br>
                        construe it as a weapon.* Spit -- Yes, spit. Your own spit can be used as a self defense tool if you're in a pinch. If you</br>
                        feel a confrontation is imminent, start conjuring up saliva in your mouth. If the person lunges at you, spit right at them --in</br>
                        the face if possible. You\'ve just done something really unexpected. The surprise throws your attacker off his game, and maybe</br>
                        even grosses him out. If you're lucky, he's also distracted wiping spit out of his eyes. This disruption is your opportunity</br>
                        to RUN and yell for help. If he's smart, he won't pursue you. Leaving your spit also leaves your DNA behind. Should this be</br>
                        a case where the attacker is arrested and you need to prove he was the one who assaulted you, mention to police that you spit</br>
                        on him. They may be able to swab the person and retrieve traces, thus proving your account of the events.</br>

                        Just put the phone away. Your calls/texts/email/social media can wait 10 more minutes. Messing with your phone means your</br>
                        eyes, mind, and hands are occupied.Your eyes should be watching where you are going and scanning your surroundings.Being</br>
                        observant of your surroundings can help you identifypotential problems before you're in the middle of them, and identify</br>

                        primarily sound. If I hadn't been on the phone, I may have heard foot steps approaching behind me. Be aware of footsteps,</br>
                        rustling bushes, approaching cars, or even arguing voices near by. Being aware is the first step to assessing whether the</br>
                        situation is a threat to your person</br>

                        from their face and will have to loosen their grip or adjust their hold to do so. This is when you break and run. Nose --</br>
                        Another place where it really hurts to get hit. If you are not confident in delivering a straight on punch to the nose, try a</br>
                        forceful upward palm. If your hands are restrained, headbutt and smash the nose. Base of the Throat -- Feel that little dent</br>
                        between your clavicles? Press it with two fingers. Uncomfortable, yes? This is one of the most effective places to jab an</br>
                        attacker. With a firm, pointed hand, jab that dent at the base of the throat. Your attacker will be surprised and will be</br>
                        gasping/ coughing uncontrollably. Use the moment break and run if possible. If they're still holding on, continue to jab, poke,</br>
                        bite, kick, and scream. Their coughing will be throwing off their ability to hang on to you effectively.</br>

                        can definitely cause someone enough pain to let you get away. Shins --2 options here. Hard kicks to the shin or rake the</br>
                        bottom of your shoe down the front of the attacker's shin. Foot stomp -- Stomp with everything you've got. Anything you</br>
                        can do to throw off your attacker's balance is in your favor. They're unlikely to do a good job of holding on to you if</br>
                        they're falling over. You're also drawing focus well away from his grasp on you.</br>

                    <td>A good way to test is to cross the street at the next possible junction. If your tailgater follows you across, remain calm and identify </br>
                        your options. Scan the area for a business you can duck into. If an employee greets you upon entering, do not be afraid to fill them in</br>
                        on the situation. Calmly and clearly explain that you think you think someone may be following you, and you have come in because you</br>
                        fear for your safety and need a few minutes of refuge. Again, most people will be understanding and helpful as long as you are calm.</br>
                        Watch from a window to see what your follower does. Most will just move on, because now you're no longer easy prey. If they linger</br>
                        outside as if waiting for you to emerge, call someone to come pick you up. The business owner may or may not ask them to leave the</br>
                        area, depending on how close they are to the private property. Do not leave the safety of the building until you are certain the follower</br>
                        has gone entirely, or until you have a buddy to escort you where you need to go. As you leave, it may be wise to change direction from</br>
                        your original walk. A smart assailant could be waiting further down the street, anticipating you will continue the same route.</br>

                        residential neighborhood. You need to get people looking out their windows or opening doors to see what's up. Stay in a well lit area</br>
                        so people can see you. Run up to somebody's porch and get under the porch light if you have to. If possible, get into a high visibility,</br>
                        public location as quickly as possible. Make sure other people can see you and your harasser clearly. Surround yourself with witnesses</br>
                        and potential allies.</br>

                        not succeed in committing violence or sexual assault, if you experienced unwanted physical contact this is an "assault" It may take</br>
                        a while for police to show up to take your statement. You may feel shaken and emotional. Do not hesitate to call a friend or knock</br>
                        on a neighbor's door and ask if they can sit with you until police arrive. Be clear when making your report and provide as much detail</br>
                        as you can. The police will ask you basics like gender, age, race, hair color, approximate height, and build. You may not know the</br>
                        attacker's actual height, but you can say things like "a little taller than your partner" and they can approximate for the report. Are</br>
                        there any other unique details you can recall? Think not just about sight, but also smell and sound. Did he smell strongly of anything</br>
                        in particular? Did he have any kid of accent when speaking? Something like this may set your attacker apart from other people of similar</br>
